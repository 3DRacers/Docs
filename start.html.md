> ![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-1.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")

Welcome driver and thanks for purchasing a 3DRacers!

You are just a few steps away from your first race: just choose one of the [available 3DRacers designs](/docs/#car-models), 3D-Print it and follows the instructions below.

Also, don't forget to download the [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/3dracers/id1054404136?l=en&mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Lib3DRacers.Lib3DRacers) app.

## What's needed

The 3DRacers Kit contains everything needed: screws, axles, gears, and a **pre-programmed 3DRacers Pilot** board.

However, depending on the quality of your print, you could also need a rasp and a bit of glue to fix some of the most commong print errors.

## Servo center

First of all, plug the Servo connector in the A port. Now plug the LiPo battery and turn on the Pilot Board. 

You'll hear the servo move to the center position.

![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-2-detail.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")

Now that the Pilot is working and the Servo is centered, you can **turn off the Board** and remove the LiPo to proceed to the next step.

<aside class="notice">
<strong>Remember to unplug the battery</strong> when you work on the board. Screws, axles and other metallic parts could cause a short-circuit!

## 1 - The small parts

Due to differences in every 3D printer, some parts will have a tolerance error. To overcome this problem, the 3DRacers models contains several variations of the same part that are 3D-printed together.

Pick the steering axles that fit better together (not too loose), and try to insert the front wheels pins. If the hole is too small use the steering arm with the "+" sign instead.
Also choose the front wheel that will rotate freely but not too loose.

<aside class="notice">
If you have troubles inserting the nails, try to scrape the hole with the scredriver to widen it
</aside>

After plugging each part, try to rotate them in position, to remove any imperfections that could be inside the holes.

## 2 - Steering mechanism

Fix the steering axle with a screw, and then the Servo axle to the servo 

![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-4.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")

Be carefull to not tighten too much the screws or rotate the Servo button

![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-4-detail.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")
![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-4-detail2.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")

Now you can put the servo and the Board in the car like in the picture, and fix them with a screw.

## 3 - The wheels

Put the rubber tires in the wheels.

## 4 - The hood

Now put the parts all together and close the hood

![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-7.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")

## 5 - The rear axle

Insert the bearings, orange gushings, rear gear and wheels as in the picture, and put them inside the car.

![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-8.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")
![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-8-detail.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")
![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-8-detail2.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")

Just roughly center the wheels, you can adjust the orange gushings position later.

## 6 - The Pilot board

Take the bearing holder that right height, and insert it together with the 3DRacers Pilot board that will hold the parts together.

Insert the screw on the most external hole of the board.

![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-9-detail.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")

Check if the motor touch the gears, and that it can spin freely. Otherwhise use an higher bearing holder.

![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-9-detail2.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")

You can also use the screw hole near the motor, that will move the board slightly forward. 

You can complete the assembly first, then it will be easier to find the right combination of hole/holder height after some trial runs.

## 7 - The sunroof

Insert the sunroof axle and the the top part. Be carefull so that the axle doesn't touch the gears.

![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-10-detail.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")

## 8 - Laterals

Add the laterals, with the Pilot board fitting inside the slits, and the sunroof axle inside the left side part.

## 9 - Final Setup

Your 3DRacers is assembled, but you need to tune the steering Servo. 

Open the App and connect to the car, and then choose Car Setup from the Options panel. 

![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/app-car-setup.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")
 
You can fine-tune the steering here:

 - Adjust the steering center if the car difts
 - Set the maximum steering angle, so that the steering Servo won't touch the car even at the maximum angle.

Your 3DRacers is now ready, well done driver! 

Now you can check out the other [car models](/docs/#car-models), or [create your own!](http://www.3dracers.com/docs/design_new_car)
