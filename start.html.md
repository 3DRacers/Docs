# Assembly guide

> ![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-complete.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")

Welcome driver and thanks for purchasing a 3DRacers!

You are just a few steps away from your first race: just choose one of the [available 3DRacers designs](/docs/#car-models), 3D-Print it and follows the instructions below.

Also, don't forget to download the [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/3dracers/id1054404136?l=en&mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Lib3DRacers.Lib3DRacers) app.

## What's needed

> ![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-1.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")

The 3DRacers Kit contains everything needed: screws, axles, gears, and a **pre-programmed 3DRacers Pilot** board.

However, depending on the quality of your print, you could also need a rasp and a bit of glue to fix some of the most commong print errors.

## Servo center

First of all, plug the `Servo` to the `A port`. Now plug the `LiPo battery` to the bigger port and turn on the `Pilot Board`. 

You'll hear the servo move to the center position.

<a href="/docimages/big/0.jpg?raw=true" target="_blank">![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-2.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")</a>

This step was useful to center the `Servo` so that it will steer equally from left to right.

Now you can turn off the Board and **remove the LiPo** to proceed to the next step.

<aside class="notice">
<strong>Remember to unplug the battery</strong> when you work on the board. Screws, axles and other metallic parts could cause a short-circuit!
</aside>

## 1 - The small parts

Due to differences in every 3D printer, some parts will have a tolerance error. 

To overcome this problem, the 3DRacers models contains several variations of the same part that are 3D-printed together.

Pick the `Steering Arms` that fit better together with the `Steering Axles` (so that can turn freely but not too loose).

<a href="/docimages/big/1.jpg?raw=true" target="_blank">![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-3.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")</a>



Also choose the `Front Wheels` (the one with a pass-trough hole) that will rotate freely but not too loose. 

If the hole in the `Steering Arm` is too small for the `Pin`, use the `Steering Arm` with the "**+**" sign instead.

<a href="/docimages/big/1bis.jpg?raw=true" target="_blank">![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-3-detail.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")</a>

<aside class="notice">
If you have troubles inserting the Pins, try to scrape the hole with the scredriver to widen it. Also printing with lower temperatures will help.
</aside>

Also, in the following guide, after plugging each part, try to rotate them in position to remove any imperfections that could be inside the holes.

## 2 - Steering mechanism

Fix the `Steering Axle` with the `Large Head Screw` in the middle hole. The Steering Axle is directed toward the bottom like in the picture.

<a href="/docimages/big/2.jpg?raw=true" target="_blank">![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-4.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")</a>

Now plug the `Servo Arm` in the `Servo`.

<aside class="notice">
Be carefull to not tighten too much the screws or force rotate the Servo!
</aside>

<a href="/docimages/big/2bis.jpg?raw=true" target="_blank">![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-4-detail.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")</a>

Now you can put the `Servo` and the Board in the car like in the picture, and fix them with one of the `Standard Screws`.

<a href="/docimages/big/2tris.jpg?raw=true" target="_blank">![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-4-detail2.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")</a>

## 3 - The wheels

Put the `Rubber Tires` on wheels.

![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-6.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")

## 4 - The hood

Now put the parts all together and close the hood

![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-7.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")

## 5 - The rear axle

Insert the `Double Gear` to the back of the car in the **bottom hole**, so that it can spin freely.

<a href="/docimages/big/5.jpg?raw=true" target="_blank">![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-8.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")</a>

Insert the `Bearings`, orange `Gushings`, `Single Gear` and `Rear Wheels` as in the picture, and put them inside the car.

<a href="/docimages/big/5bis.jpg?raw=true" target="_blank">![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-8-detail.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")</a>

<aside class="notice">
No need to center the wheels exactly, it's easier to adjust the orange Bushings position later.
</aside>


## 6 - The Pilot board

Take the `Bearing holder` with the right height, so that will reach the same level of the adjacent parts.

Now insert the 3DRacers Pilot board and fix it with a screw in the **external hole** of the board.

![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-9.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")
![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-9-detail.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")

Check if the motor touch the gears, and that it can spin freely. 

You can adjust the height of the board (and so of the `Motor`) changing the `Bearing Holder`:

![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-9-detail2.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")

Also by changing the hole for the screw, the board will move to the front by 0.5mm.

<aside class="notice">
It's easier to adjust Board position later, after your first assembly it will be easier to find the right combination of hole/holder height.
</aside>

## 7 - The roof

Insert the `Small Axle` and the roof part. Be carefull so that the axle doesn't touch the `Double Gear`.

![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-10-detail.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")

## 8 - Laterals

Add the laterals, with the Pilot board fitting inside the slits, and the sunroof axle inside the left side part.

![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/assembly-11-detail.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")

## 9 - Final Setup

Your 3DRacers is assembled, but you need to tune the steering Servo. 

Open the App and connect to the car, and then choose Car Setup from the Options panel. 

![3DRacers Assembly Guide](/docimages/app-car-setup.jpg?raw=true "3DRacers Assembly Guide")
 
You can fine-tune the steering here:

 - Adjust the steering center if the car difts
 - Set the maximum steering angle, so that the steering Servo won't touch the car even at the maximum angle.

Your 3DRacers is now ready, well done driver!
